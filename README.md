## Introduction

Predicting college admissions is a critical task for educational institutions to manage resources and plan effectively. In this project, we have utilized two powerful models for time series forecasting:

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A popular statistical method for time series analysis.
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence prediction.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

2. **Train ARIMA Model**: Train the ARIMA model using the preprocessed data.

```bash
python src/arima_model.py
```

3. **Train LSTM Model**: Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data.

```bash
python src/lstm_model.py
```

## Models

### ARIMA Model

The ARIMA model is a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting. It combines AutoRegression (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA) components to predict future values based on past data.

### LSTM Model

The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network that can learn long-term dependencies in sequence data. It is particularly effective for time series forecasting due to its ability to retain information over long periods.

## Results

We have obtained promising results with both models. The ARIMA model provides a solid statistical approach, while the LSTM model leverages deep learning to capture complex patterns in the data. Below are the results of our models:
